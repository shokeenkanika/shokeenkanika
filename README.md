## Hello World! 

About me: 

- I use this repository to post my exploratory research on topics that face funding gaps, or that are otherwise unpopular in mainstream literature. I welcome your feedback and comments, as they help me learn and improve on future work.
- Development Data Nerd: When science-driven policy becomes the norm (and not the exception) in the Global South, they will need a policy impact advisor, and I want that job.
- I have a STEM graduate degree in public policy (MPP), with certificate coursework in data analytics and survey research.
- I deeply resonate with the quote “Integrity is what you do when no one is watching.” I believe in putting forth honesty in my work, because social science research impacts the lives of real people.
